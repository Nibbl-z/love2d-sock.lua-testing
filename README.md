This is a simple space invaders clone which is multiplayer made with Love2D and the sock.lua library.

# How to run

If you are hosting, download `Space.Defenders.Server.zip` from the releases and run it.

Players will need to put in your IP address in order to join.

I don't know which IP address because I don't know much about networking, and I think you'll also have to port forward or something.

If you don't wanna do that, then you can connect to Hamachi and players can join through that.
